    <h1>History of C programming language</h1>
    <h3>It is good to learn about the history of C programming. C was developed and written by Dennis M. Ritchie in the year 1972, and hence he is known as the founder of C.<br>

C programming language was developed to overcome the difficulties found in older programming languages such as BCPL, BASIC, B, etc.<br></h3>

                C is imperative language and designed to compile in a relatively straightforward manner which provides low-level access to the memory. With the gradual increase in the popularity of the program, the language and its compiler have become available on a wide range of platforms from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.<br>
With the introduction of K&R C language (which is a new edition of C published in 1978 by Brian Kernighan and Denis Ritchie), several features have been included in C language.</h3>
            <h2>Some of these features are:</h2>
